* The purpose of this article
Here I'm going to illustrate:

*Using anyone of programming languages, with only two operations: string concatenation and type conversion, we have no needs to use template languages*, such as format in "printf" of C language, [[https://mustache.github.io/][mustache]], [[https://shopify.github.io/liquid/][liquid]], [[http://jinja.pocoo.org/][jinja2]] and etc.

You can review the opinion in this article with template languages in web application frameworks, such as [[https://vuejs.org/][vuejs]], [[https://angular.io/][angularjs]], and [[https://reactjs.org/][reactjs]] and etc.(And reactjs do it in right ways somewhat.)

You can also review the opinion in this article with [[https://secure.php.net/][PHP]], [[https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javaee/jsp/index.html][JSP]] and [[https://www.asp.net][ASP]].

* To illustrate, Using examples
Here I choose "emacs lisp" as the programming language to illustrate the process.

** "printf" in C language
#+BEGIN_SRC C
int main(void)
{
char MyName[] = "Wang Bowen";
int MyAge = 26;
printf("Hello world, my name is %s, my age is %d", MyName, MyAge);
return 0;
}
#+END_SRC

Where the process must parse "Hello world, my name is %s, my age is %d", find "%s" and "%d", then replace these with MyName and Myage which is going to be conversed into string.

Whereas we can make the process done using emacs lisp in this way:

#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
  (setq MyName "Wang Bowen"
        MyAge  26)
  (message
     (concat "Hello, world, my name is "
             MyName
             ", my age is "
             (int-to-string MyAge)))
#+END_SRC
"message" outputs the concatenated string into console.

"concat" concatenates the strings.

"int-to-string" converses the "int" type variable into string.

All are direct. We don't need to parse "Hello world, my name is %s, my age is %d".

** mustache
Using hash:

{
 "MyName":"Wang Bowen",
 "MyAge":26
}

We have to parse the string:

#+BEGIN_SRC html
Hello world, my name is {{MyName}}, my age is {{MyAge}}
#+END_SRC

Then give the result.

Whereas we can make the process done using emacs lisp in this way:

#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
  (setq MyName "Wang Bowen"
        MyAge  26)
  (message
     (concat "Hello, world, my name is "
             MyName
             ", my age is "
             (int-to-string MyAge)))
#+END_SRC

** liquid
The same as mustache.

Whereas we can make the process done using emacs lisp in this way:

#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
  (setq MyName "Wang Bowen"
        MyAge  26)
  (message
     (concat "Hello, world, my name is "
             MyName
             ", my age is "
             (int-to-string MyAge)))
#+END_SRC

** jinja2
The same as liquid.

Whereas we can make the process done using emacs lisp in this way:

#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
  (setq MyName "Wang Bowen"
        MyAge  26)
  (message
     (concat "Hello, world, my name is "
             MyName
             ", my age is "
             (int-to-string MyAge)))
#+END_SRC

* If you want logic operation and iteration, just use what the programming language itself have.
* Generally Speaking
When we input the data, and want the output as text file, we can directly create the process using programming languages:

#+CAPTION: the principle
[[file:RDS.png]]

Where the "DS" stands for "Data Structure" and the "RDS" stands for "Runnable Data Structure". Source code in one programming languages can be regarded as "Runnable Data structure".

There is no need to create a new template languages to make the process complicated. And if we do it in this way, we will omit the procedure parsing template languages so that *the process speeds up*, what's more, *it can be easier to make the process in parallel* (yes, multiple string concatenation can be done in parallel).
